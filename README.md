# HOTEL RESERVATION CANCELLATION PREDICTION (MLOps)

## Objective:

The online hotel reservation channels have dramatically changed booking possibilities and customersâ€™ behavior. A significant number of hotel reservations are called-off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with.

Can you predict if the customer is going to honor the reservation or cancel it ?

So to Solve this busines problem,
* I have Collected and preprocessed hotel booking data
* Explored multiple machine learning models
* Evaluated models using F1-score metric to balance precision & recall, since both false positives (predicting cancel when not) and false negatives (predicting not cancel when cancel) are costly.
* Identified the most important features influencing cancellation behavior using feature importance analysis.

### Final Model Selection

* Chosen Model: LightGBM (Light Gradient-Boosting Machine)
* Performance: Achieved an F1-score of 89% on the test dataset.

### Business Value:

* Hotels can use this predictive system to forecast cancellations in advance,

* Apply dynamic pricing,

* Offer targeted retention incentives, or

* Overbook strategically to minimize revenue loss.

## Dataset Description [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-datasetO)

The dataset contains hotel booking records collected from an online reservation system. Each record represents a booking along with customer details, stay information, and the final booking outcome (canceled or Not canceled).

Key Characteristics:

  * Labeled dataset â†’ outcome for each booking is known.
  
  * Mix of categorical & numerical features (e.g., room_type_reserved, market_segment_type vs. lead_time, avg_price_per_room).

  * Dynamic behavior captured (e.g., changing prices, lead time, special requests).

  * Customer history included (repeated_guest, no_of_previous_cancellations, etc.), which is valuable for predictive modeling.

  * Imbalanced classes â†’ cancellations of the reservation is 28.7%

## Techinques used

#### Data Balancing

   * Applied Oversampling (SMOTE) to handle the class imbalance in the target variable (booking_status) on the training set.

#### Skewness Test

   * Applied log transform on highly skewed collumns

#### Feature Engineering & Encoding

   * Implemented Label Encoding to convert categorical features (e.g., room_type_reserved, market_segment_type, etc.) into numerical form suitable for machine learning algorithms.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   * Conducted data visualization (using Matplotlib, Seaborn, SHAP) to uncover patterns and relationships between features such as avg_price_per_room, lead_time, and cancellation likelihood.

### ðŸ”‘ Top Influencing Features

1. avg_price_per_room (3751 importance)

    * Customers are highly sensitive to room price.

    * If the price is too high, customers may cancel or switch to cheaper alternatives.

    * If the price is low/discounted, they are more likely to stick with the booking.

    * Business implication: Competitive pricing and targeted discounts can reduce cancellations.

2. lead_time (3735 importance)

    * A long gap between booking and stay increases the chance of cancellation (plans change, emergencies arise, better deals appear).

    * Shorter lead times usually mean higher commitment from customers.

    * Business implication: Introduce flexible pricing or cancellation penalties for long lead-time bookings.

3. Seasonality and booking channel play secondary but still plays important roles.
